Hoi! I’m Vinicius. I’m committed to exploring this world with empathy and curiosity. I try to understand current systems in order to leave things better than I found them.

I like learning about history, languages, art, and so many other things. For the past decade and a half, I have embraced the exciting intersection of open source, software development, and human-computer interaction.

Currently, I’m a designer [at this very website](https://github.com). Here I’m helping to scale its design system, improve workflows, and support a global community.

In the past, I designed systems for developer tools at Microsoft; I created web apps, brand, and websites for Xamarin; and I contributed to the GNOME project by designing websites, assets, and icons.

And ever since my first experience with open source, I have been collaborating and learning from immensely talented people.

I was born when the planet had 354 [ppm](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-atmospheric-carbon-dioxide) of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. I grew up in the Brazilian southeast coast, and have been calling San Francisco home since 2012.
