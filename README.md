**Hoi! I’m Vinicius. I believe that empathy and curiosity about why we move through this world the way we do are key to solving problems.**

I like learning about history, languages, art, and so many other things. For the past decade I have embraced the exciting intersection of code, product, and design.

Currently, I’m designing this [very website](https://github.com). Here I’m helping to scale its design system and improve workflows for developers around the globe.

[In the past](https://adxlv.co/work/) I designed [thoughtful web services](https://adxlv.co/work/azure-devops/) for Microsoft in the Cloud & AI division. Before that, I [joined Xamarin](https://adxlv.co/work/xamarin/) as their first designer, and ever since I’ve been collaborating with immensely talented people.

I grew up in the Brazilian southeast coast, and been calling San Francisco home for almost a decade.
